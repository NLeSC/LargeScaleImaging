\subsection{Saliency}
In \cite{LCAV-CONF-2009-012}, the authors introduce a method for salient region detection that  outputs full resolution saliency maps with well-defined boundaries of salient objects. These boundaries are  preserved by retaining substantially more frequency  content from the original image than other existing  techniques. The method exploits features of color and luminance, is simple to implement, and is computationally  efficient. ...
