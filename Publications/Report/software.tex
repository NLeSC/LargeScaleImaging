The saliency detection tools developed by the researchers are often made available to the community.

\subsection{Saliency}
\subsubsection{SaliencyToolbox}
The SaliencyToolbox is a collection of Matlab functions and scripts for computing the saliency map for an image, for determining the extent of a proto-object, and for serially scanning the image with the focus of attention. 

\subsubsection{Frequency-tuned Saliency}
The code used in the CVPR 2009 paper ``Frequency-tuned Salient Region Detection'' (\cite{LCAV-CONF-2009-012}) is accessible through the online presentation of the work at \cite{achantaCVPR09}.
