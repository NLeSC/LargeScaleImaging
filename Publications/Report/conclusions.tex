To goal of  this report wasnot to make extensive study of the state of the art in large-scale image processing and machine vision state of the art. Rather it aimed at giving the reader a general overview and useful pointers to where one might direct research and development effords. It is also important to know the curent trends in the field tobe able to sustain some level of expertise init.

Based on researching the articles, software, the ever growing number of research image datasets and the (scientific) application domains two main concusions crystalize:
